# ALGORITHM FIX SUMMARY

## Issue Identified
The main problem was with **item-based collaborative filtering** causing memory allocation errors when trying to compute similarity for 9,066+ movies (requiring ~627 MB for a 9066x9066 matrix).

## âœ… Fixes Applied

### 1. Memory-Optimized Item Similarity Computation (`src/similarity.py`)
- **Problem**: Memory error when computing cosine similarity for large item matrices
- **Solution**: 
  - Limited item similarity computation to top 5,000 most-rated items
  - Added sparse matrix representation for memory efficiency
  - Implemented chunked computation (500 items per chunk)
  - Added fallback to top 100 items if memory issues persist
  - Added progress indicators for user feedback

### 2. Enhanced Item-Based Recommendations (`src/recommend.py`)
- **Problem**: Movies not found in reduced similarity matrix
- **Solution**:
  - Added fallback logic for movies not in similarity matrix
  - Genre-based fallback recommendations
  - Popular movies fallback as last resort
  - Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Algorithm Status After Fixes
âœ… **Collaborative Filtering**: Working (both user-based and item-based)
âœ… **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: Working  
âœ… **Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: Working
âœ… **Hybrid System**: Working
âœ… **A/B Testing**: Working

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Improvements
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced from ~627 MB to manageable chunks
- **Computation Time**: Chunked processing with progress indicators
- **Robustness**: Added multiple fallback strategies
- **User Experience**: Better error messages and feedback

## ðŸš€ Current Status
All recommendation algorithms are now working correctly in both:
- âœ… Command-line testing (`debug_algorithms.py`)
- âœ… Streamlit web application (`enhanced_app.py`)

## ðŸ“Š Features Available
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: User-based and item-based recommendations
2. **Matrix Factorization**: SVD and NMF algorithms
3. **Hybrid System**: Combines multiple algorithms with weighted scoring
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare algorithm performance with statistical analysis
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Diversity scoring, recommendation explanations
6. **Database Integration**: SQLite-based caching and user interaction tracking

## ðŸŽ¬ Ready for Production
The movie recommender system now supports all advanced features and handles memory constraints gracefully. Users can access all recommendation types through the Streamlit interface at: http://localhost:8501
